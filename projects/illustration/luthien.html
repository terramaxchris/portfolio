                        <h2>Lay of Leithian Rock Opera (Luthien Animation) Project</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is concept art for an animation project I don't think I'll 
                            ever actually have time to do, but I do hope to try.  It came from 
                            watching ballet clips on Instagram and then finding an ideal piece of 
                            music on YouTube: 
                        </p>
                        <p><u>
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDH3g6rRjM8">
                            The soundtrack of Ocarina of Time, but it's a prog rock concept album</a>
                        </u></p>
                        <p>
                            The idea is to animate <em>The Lay of Leithian</em> from the Silmarillion as a ballet, 
                            using this music.  The music, which is about 30 minutes long and is a medly of different 
                            music from the Ocarina of Time video game, is broken up into sections that work well as 
                            different points in the story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A major influence in this idea os the cut scenes from early 2000s jrpgs, which didn't have 
                            voice acting yet and would instead choreograph non-verbal scenes to depict important story moments. 
                            Because of this I would want the entire thing to be non-verbal; there's something elegant about that 
                            style to me, and from my limited understanding, ballet seems like a good fit for that style.
