                        <p>
                            Someone online described a particular scece--the one in the thumbnail--
                            and Sauron with "Botticelli face".  I thought that was hilarious, and so I 
                            tried to draw that scene in a Botticelli-esque style.  I liked how it turned 
                            out well enough that I then did several more.

                                and matching of reference images, because it all the good images of her in profile were 
                                not int he dress I wanted to draw.  Mixing and matching rerference s always a bad idea.  
                                Her hand is intended to be a little funky int he same way
