                        <h2>Turin Turambar Animation Project</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is concept art for an animation project centered around 
                            the story of Turin in the Silmarillion.  It's similar to the 
                            Luthien animation project, but much shorter.  It would also be 
                            non verbal ballet, but the single song is only about a minute 
                            and a half.  I have some hope that this smaller project is more 
                            achievable, and could be a practice run for the other larger one.
