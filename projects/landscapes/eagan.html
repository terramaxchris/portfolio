                        <h2>Eagan</h2>
                        <p>
                            I found a job in Eagan that's on a bus line, to facilitate by car free life.  It makes for 
                            a lot of time spent walking and waiting in spaces that most people don't usually go, and I 
                            really like how that makes me engage with the space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Except in the winter, because Eagan doesn't clear the sidewalks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking the bus also means i can take photos from the window in a way you 
                            never could while driving, and there's some very nice scenery on 35-E.
