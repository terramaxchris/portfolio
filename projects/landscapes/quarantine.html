                        <p>
                            I was living with my parents in Burnsville and working in Minneapolis public schools 
                            when the pandemic started in earnest in 2020.  When they shut down the schools and then shifted 
                            to remote learning for the rest of the school year, I suddenly had a lot of free time, and 
                            very little I could do with it.  Perhaps you've heard this story....
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I filled my time for those first few months by driving to my favorite small company, 
                            Indigo Tea Company, buying a latte and a snack, and then eating it in the parking lot while 
                            I drew something in the landscape around me.  (Indigo Tea Company, if you live in the Twin 
                            Cities metro area, is a place you should absoltuely check out.  It's a small family-owned business
                            that's driven by the owner's passion for tea.  It has a beautiful interior space, including both 
                            tables with chairs you can sit at and tatami mats with short tables you can sit/kneel on, and a rack 
                            of tea cannistaers so you can smell the flavors before you try them.   
                            <a href="https://www.indigo-tea.com/">Support small businesses!</a>)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started this practice with the thought that <em>any</em> landscape can be interesting and even beautiful 
                            if you choose to engage with it and look deeply.  EVen if I drew the same place over and over, I would try to 
                            find something different to focus on every day.  SInce I had no idea how long the shut down would last, it was 
                            a very open-ended project, and I figured I'd just see how long I could keep it up, whether the shut down or my 
                            attention span lasted longer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I always <em>started</em> a new picture every day, but I didn't always actually managed to finish.  At the time I 
                            thought I'd come back and finish later, since there seemed to be infinite time.  Sometimes I did.  But sometimes I 
                            didn't, and since these were nearly all drawn in person rather than from photos, I wasn't able to go back and finish 
                            things once too much time had passed, because the seasons changed and the landscapes didn't look the same.  Now some 
                            of the trees have been cut down.  So, there are not as many images as you mgiht expect when I say--my attention outlasted 
                            the circumstances.
