                        <p>
                            I started drawing landscapes in Seattle some years before what's posted 
                            here, but that work is saved on a machine I don't currently have 
                            easy access to.  These few were all drawn in 2019, in the late winter and 
                            early spring during a period when I was only partially employed and 
                            waiting on a job application to decide whether to stay or move back to 
                            Minnesota.  I didn't get the job and decided to move, but during the wait 
                            I spent my time going to favorite spot sin the city to draw.

                            <p>
                                I moved to Seattle in 2012 because I was in a deadend job and 
                                wanted a change, and I had a friend who'd moved there the year before.  
                                It was an extremely expensive city to live in, especially with  
                                student loan debt and an art degree.  I stayed there until 2019, at which 
                                point I got fed up with the rising cost of housing and one dead-end job 
                                after another.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It wasn't an unambiguously positive experience.  But, I learned to use public 
                                transit there.  And public transit taught me to experience places differently; 
                                you have to walk more, and wait in random places.  And it was in Seattle where 
                                I first started trying tio draw landscapes regularly, as a discipline, to learn 
                                how to do it better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A lot of the work I did durng that era is on an old computer harddrive that I 
                                haven't accessed in years.  At some point I need to make the effort to take it 
                                somewhere where they can get those files for me.  But because I was still really 
                                inexperienced with landscapes, a lot of that work wasn't very good; these are 
                                the ones I bothered to move to DropBox because they were some of the best.
